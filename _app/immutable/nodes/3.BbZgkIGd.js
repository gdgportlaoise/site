		everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities,
		neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or
		other protected category. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. GDG
		Portlaoise takes violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately.
		<br/> <br/>
		All participants of GDG Portlaoise community &amp; events must abide by the following policy:
		<br/> <br/></p> <ol><li>1. Be excellent to each other.
			<br/> <br/>
			We want the event to be an excellent experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and
			expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity,
			nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category. Treat everyone with respect. Participate
			while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here -- and each of us has the right to enjoy
			our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or
			via micro-aggressions. Jokes shouldn’t demean others. Consider what you are saying and how it would
			feel if it were said to or about you.</li> <br/> <li>2. Speak up if you see or hear something.
			<br/> <br/>
			Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected.
			The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely
			bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged. If a participant engages in harassing
			or uncomfortable behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
			warning or expelling the offender from the event with no refund. If you are being harassed or feel
			uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact
			a member of the event staff immediately.</li> <br/> <li>3. Harassment is not tolerated.
			<br/> <br/>
			Harassment includes, but is not limited to: verbal language that reinforces social structures of
			domination related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity,
			physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected
			category; sexual imagery in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing
			photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; offensive verbal language;
			inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any
			harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</li> <br/> <li>4.Practice saying &quot;Yes and&quot; to each other.
			<br/> <br/>
			It’s a theatre improv technique to build on each other’s ideas. We all benefit when we create together.</li></ol> <br/> <p>This policy extends to talks, forums, workshops, codelabs, social media, parties, hallway
		conversations, all attendees, partners, sponsors, volunteers, event staff, etc. You catch our
		drift. GDG Portlaoise reserves the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person from, any
		GDG Portlaoise hosted event (including future GDG Portlaoise events) at any time in its sole
		discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, attendees behaving in a disorderly manner or
		failing to comply with this policy, and the terms and conditions herein. If a participant
		engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event organizers may take any action they
		deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the event with no refund.
		<br/>
		Our event staff can usually be identified by special badges/attire. Our zero tolerance policy means
		that we will look into and review every allegation of violation of our Event Community Guidelines
		and Anti-Harassment Policy and respond appropriately. Please note, while we take all concerns raised
		seriously, we will use our discretion as to determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents,
		and may decline to take any further action and/or may direct the participant to other resources for
		resolution.
		<br/> <br/>
		Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement,
		provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing discomfort or harassment to feel safe for
		the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
		<br/> <br/>
		Exhibiting partners, sponsors or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to this policy.
		In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth
		staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create
		a sexualized environment. Participants and exhibiting partners or sponsors disobeying this policy
		will be notified and are expected to stop any offending behavior immediately.
		<br/> <br/></p> <h3 class="text-lg">Why this policy is important</h3> <p><br/>
		Harassment at events and in online communities is unfortunately common. Creating an official policy
		aims to improve this by making it clear that harassment of anyone for any reason is not acceptable
		within our events and communities. This policy may prevent harassment by clearly defining expectations
		for behavior, aims to provide reassurance, and encourages people who have had bad experiences at
		other events to participate in this one.
